Introduction of operating system==>
__________________________________

Computer software can ruffly be divided
into two types.
(1) Application software
(2) system software

(1) Application software==>
__________________________

Which performs the actual work the
user wants.

(2) System software==>
______________________

which manage the operation of the
computer itself.
The most fundamental system program
is the operating system, who's job
is to control all the computer's
resources and provide a base upon
which the application program can be
written.
Operating system acts as an inter-
mediary between a user of computer and
the computer hardware.

History of operating system==>
______________________________

opreating systems have involved through
a number of distinct phases as genrations.

(1) First generation (1940)==>
______________________________

The earliest electronic digital computer
had no operating system.Machine of
this time were so premative that per-
forms were often entered one bit at
time on rows of machanical switches
programming languages were unknown.

(2) Second generation (1950)==>
_______________________________

By the early 1950's the routine of
improved some what with the intro-
duction of punch cards .The general
motors research laboratories emple-
mented the first opreating system
in early 1950's for their IBM 701.

(3) Third generation (1960)==>

The system of 1960's where also 
batch processing system but they 
were able to take better advantages
of the computer resources by running
several jobs at once.
So operating systems designer's
developed the concept of multi-
programming in which several jobs are
in main memory at once.

(4) Fourth generation (1970)==>
_______________________________

With the development of LSI(large
scale integration) circuits, chips,
operating system entered in the per-
sonl computer.Micro processor technology
involved to the desktop computer.
To opreating systems have dominated
the personal computer scene M.s Dos
written by Microsoft for IBM PC and 
UNIX for Motorola 16899 CPU family.
